    "Single mature acorn with distinctive brown cap and shell, among autumn leaves"
    "Same brown acorn with recognizable cap pattern, extreme close-up detail"
    "Same acorn falling through air, distinctive markings visible, dramatic descent"
    "Same acorn resting on moss-covered forest floor, peaceful landing"
    "Same acorn being soaked by rain, water droplets on brown shell"
    "Same acorn beginning to crack slightly, internal changes starting"
    
    # Act 2: Germination & Early Growth (Scenes 7-12)
    "Same acorn covered in winter snow, shell intact but weathered"
    "Same acorn with shell cracking open, tiny green shoot emerging from crack"
    "Small oak sprout with first leaves, emerged from cracked acorn shell"
    "Young oak seedling with several leaves, about 6 inches tall"
    "Small oak sapling with developing leaves, about 1 foot tall"
    "Young oak sapling with stronger stem and more leaves, about 2 feet tall"
    
    # Act 3: Youth & Growth (Scenes 13-18)
    "5-year-old oak tree with small trunk and developing branches, about 6 feet tall"
    "Young oak tree with spreading root system visible, developing underground network"
    "10-year-old oak with visible growth rings in trunk, about 12 feet tall"
    "15-year-old oak tree bending in storm, flexible but strong, about 20 feet tall"
    "20-year-old oak with wildlife habitat, birds and animals in branches"
    "25-year-old oak breaking through forest understory, reaching toward canopy"
    
    # Act 4: Maturity & Legacy (Scenes 19-24)
    "50-year-old mature oak tree producing first acorns, parental stage"
    "Same mature oak tree with visible acorns in branches, genetic continuation"
    "100-year-old ancient oak tree, massive trunk and spreading canopy"
