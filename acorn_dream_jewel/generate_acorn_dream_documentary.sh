# Character-Driven Script with Emotional Arc
declare -a narrations=(
    "From the crown of a 200-year-old oak, a single acorn begins life's greatest journey."
    "This tiny seed carries genetic memories of centuries, the blueprint for a forest giant."
    "The fall is terrifying - 80 feet to forest floor, survival completely uncertain."
    "Our acorn lands in rich soil, but the real adventure is just beginning."
    "Autumn rain soaks deep, awakening ancient programming written in oak DNA."
    "Inside the shell, mysterious changes begin - the first stirrings of new life."
    "Winter tests everything - freeze, thaw, freeze again. Our brave acorn endures."
    "Spring arrives with a miracle - the tiniest green shoot breaks through the shell."
    "This fragile sprout faces giants: hungry deer, summer drought, and towering darkness above."
    "Year one is pure survival - reaching desperately for any sunlight filtering through."
    "The young oak learns the forest's secret language of chemical signals and warnings."
    "Each captured leaf becomes fuel for the impossible dream of touching the sky."
    "By year five, our oak begins to understand its true nature and potential."
    "Roots spread like highways underground, claiming territory and partnering with ancient fungi."
    "The trunk thickens, storing decades of summers in rings of living history."
    "Our oak weathers its first major storm - bending dramatically but never breaking."
    "Wildlife discovers this growing sanctuary - birds, squirrels, countless insects find home here."
    "Twenty years old, our oak finally rises above the understory into glorious sunlight."
    "At 50 years, our oak begins producing its own acorns - becoming a parent."
    "Each new acorn carries forward the genetic wisdom of survival and resilience."
    "A century later, our oak stands as forest patriarch, sheltering countless generations."
    "Its roots connect every tree around, sharing nutrients and protecting the young saplings."
    "In its crown, the great-great-grandchildren of early visitors build their entire lives."
    "One acorn's dream became a universe - proof that smallest beginnings hold infinite potential."
