**Week 2:**
- Environmental/themed episode ("Wildlife At The Limits" style)
- OR continuation of location series

**Week 3:**
- Another "Wild [Location]" or special series

## üéØ **KEY TAKEAWAY FOR HIDDEN NATURE**

**Free Documentary Nature's Formula:**
- **Focused Series** (not random animals)
- **Geographic + Thematic Anchors** (Wild [Place], Talents [Skill], Limits [Environment])
- **44-59 minute length** (optimal for YouTube algorithm + viewer retention)
- **Professional production** (real footage, great narration, cinematic)
- **Consistent upload schedule** (trains algorithm + builds audience loyalty)
- **YouTube-ONLY strategy** (doesn't dilute effort across 5 platforms)
- **High production value** (not shortcuts, premium cinematography)

**Our Advantage**: **3:12 format + multi-platform** (they ignore TikTok/Shorts/Substack - we own those niches)

---

## üìà **VIEW COUNT EXPECTATIONS FOR HIDDEN NATURE**

If we follow their formula but with our multi-platform advantage:

- **Main Documentary (YouTube)**: 30-80K views within 2 weeks (starting point)
- **YouTube Shorts**: 5-20K per clip (underexploited niche)
- **TikTok**: 10-50K per clip (theynot doing this!)
- **Substack**: 500-2K subscribers building (they not doing this!)

**Our advantage**: We're not competing on their long-form turf; we're winning on niches they ignore.
