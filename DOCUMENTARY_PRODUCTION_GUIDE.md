## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP PRODUCTION CHECKLIST**

### **Phase 1: Project Setup**
- [ ] **Create clean project directory** for the documentary
- [ ] **Copy .env file** with API keys to project directory
- [ ] **Define documentary topic** and target channel (Science, Nature, History, Psychology)
- [ ] **Choose narrator voice** (Rachel for cosmic/science, Roger for nature/dramatic, etc.)

### **Phase 2: Script Development**
- [ ] **Research inspiration sources** (Carl Sagan transcripts, Attenborough documentaries)
- [ ] **Write educational script** with natural flow and proper scientific/narrative depth
- [ ] **Structure script into 20-25 focused scenes** (one clear concept per scene)
- [ ] **Target 15-20 words per scene** for natural 6-8 second delivery
- [ ] **Include visual descriptions** for each scene with specific details

### **Phase 3: Narration Generation**
- [ ] **Extract all narration text** from script into array format
- [ ] **Generate ALL narration audio first** using ElevenLabs in parallel
  - Voice: Rachel/Roger/etc.
  - Stability: 0.5
  - Similarity boost: 0.75
  - Style: 0.7 (high expressiveness)
  - Speed: 1.0
- [ ] **Measure actual narration durations** for each scene
- [ ] **Identify scenes that are too short** (under 6s) or too long (over 8s)
- [ ] **Regenerate problematic scenes** with expanded/condensed narration to hit 6-8s target

### **Phase 4: Visual Continuity Planning**
- [ ] **Define consistent character descriptions** (appearance, coloring, distinctive features)
- [ ] **Define consistent environment** (same location throughout)
- [ ] **Plan lighting progression** (dawn ‚Üí day ‚Üí sunset ‚Üí twilight for natural flow)
- [ ] **Choose consistent seed number** for visual continuity (e.g., 77777)
- [ ] **Create detailed prompt templates** with consistency elements

### **Phase 5: Video Generation**
- [ ] **Generate ALL videos in parallel** using consistent prompts:
  - Duration: 8 seconds (allows buffer for 6-7s narration)
  - Include consistent character descriptions in every prompt
  - Include consistent environment in every prompt
  - Include appropriate lighting for scene timing
  - Add "no speech, no dialogue, ambient only" to avoid conflicts
  - Use same seed across all scenes
- [ ] **Wait for all video completions** before proceeding
- [ ] **Verify all videos downloaded** successfully

### **Phase 6: Audio-Video Mixing**
- [ ] **Mix each scene individually** with proper audio levels:
  - Veo3 ambient audio: 0.05x volume (subtle background)
  - Narration audio: 1.5x volume (prominent and clear)
  - Use amix with dropout_transition=2 for smooth blending
- [ ] **Verify each mixed scene** has both video and audio working
- [ ] **Check for any missing or failed scenes**

### **Phase 7: Final Compilation**
- [ ] **Create scene list file** with all mixed scenes in order
- [ ] **Compile final documentary** using FFmpeg concat
- [ ] **Verify final video specs**:
  - Duration: ~3 minutes (23 scenes √ó 8s)
  - Resolution: 1280x720 (16:9 aspect ratio)
  - Audio: Clear narration with subtle ambient background
- [ ] **Test final video** for synchronization and quality
