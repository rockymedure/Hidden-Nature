    "This is Anju. Most people see mushrooms. She sees apartment buildings."
    "In three days, this mushroom becomes home to dozens of residents."
    "Day one. The doors just opened. The first tenants are already arriving."
    "Meet the pioneers - fungus gnats here to lay eggs."
    "Within hours, their larvae begin excavating tunnels through the flesh."
    "The beetles arrive next. They'll move in and never leave."
    "What looks simple is actually a thriving micro-city."
    "Some tenants are gourmets. This slug only eats specific species."
    "Its tongue has twenty-seven thousand teeth, adapted for fungal dining."
    "Springtails don't just eat mushrooms - they farm bacteria inside them."
    "Where there's prey, there are predators patrolling the corridors."
    "In the shadows, pseudoscorpions wait. Tiny venomous landlords."
    "Larger residents depend on mushrooms to survive winter."
    "Squirrels curate mushroom collections, drying them like jerky."
    "Deer seek specific species for minerals plants can't provide."
    "A single mushroom can house twenty species and hundreds of residents."
    "Some mushrooms are predators. This one sets microscopic snares."
    "Once trapped, the fungus injects enzymes. The worm becomes food."
    "This ant is dead - controlled by a fungus that hijacked its brain."
    "The fungus made it climb to exact height and temperature - then killed it."
    "Now it broadcasts spores to infect the next generation. Precise. Lethal. Beautiful."
    "Summit disease. This fungus forces flies to climb high - then erupts."
    "Week two. The apartment is condemned. Residents evacuate en masse."
    "As it dies, the mushroom releases trillions of spores - future cities."
    "Within days, new apartments rise. The cycle begins again."
    "Forests aren't just trees. They're cities within cities - and we're only beginning to see the residents."
