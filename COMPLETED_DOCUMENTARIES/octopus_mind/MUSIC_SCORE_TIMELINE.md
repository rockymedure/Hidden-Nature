- **Sustaining pads/drones** maintain sonic continuity
- **Rhythmic motifs** transform rather than stop/start  
- **Harmonic progressions** flow naturally between keys
- **Instrumental handoffs** create seamless transitions
- **Thematic development** evolves across multiple scenes

## ðŸŽµ **FOR MUSIC GENERATOR:**

**Generate as continuous 3:28 piece with these sections, NOT as 26 separate cues**
- Transitions are critical - instruments must sustain across scene boundaries
- Keys progress logically - no jarring modulations
- Themes recur and develop - not isolated ideas
- Dynamic arc flows: p â†’ fff â†’ p across entire duration
- Think: One symphony movement, not isolated sound effects

**Recommended Approach:** Generate longer segments (30-60s) that span multiple scenes, ensuring natural flow
