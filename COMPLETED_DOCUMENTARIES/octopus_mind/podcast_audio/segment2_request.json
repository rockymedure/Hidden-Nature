I'd been waiting at this rocky outcropping, and suddenly these eight arms just... unfurl from the crevice. Like watching a flower bloom, except this flower has three hearts and blue blood.",

Just hung there, arms spread, taking in the entire reef. His skin was doing this thing - these color patterns I'd never seen before. Maroons bleeding into electric blues. And I remember thinking: he's thinking. He's making calculations about his world.",
