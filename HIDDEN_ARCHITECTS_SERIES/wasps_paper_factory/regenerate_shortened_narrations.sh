# DRAMATICALLY shortened narrations - targeting 5-7 seconds natural delivery

    # Scene 1 - was 16.67s
    "Wasps invented paper. Thousands of years before humans."
    
    # Scene 2 - was 13.64s
    "They scrape wood fiber. Transform it with saliva. Something entirely new."
    
    # Scene 3 - was 15.57s
    "Inside the wasp's mouth: magic happens. A pulping machine smaller than a grain of rice."
    
    # Scene 4 - was 12.43s
    "The wasp flies home. Carrying its own body weight in processed fiber."
    
    # Scene 5 - was 11.81s
    "At the nest entrance: a coordinated handoff. Assembly line precision."
    
    # Scene 6 - was 13.24s
    "Inside, master builders sculpt fiber into something impossible. Paper."
    
    # Scene 7 - was 16.67s
    "Hexagons. Perfect six-sided chambers. The most efficient shape in nature."
    
    # Scene 8 - was 15.39s
    "One nest: 300 hexagonal cells. Each one perfect. Built in darkness."
    
    # Scene 9 - was 14.21s
    "Lightweight but strong. Breathable. Durable. Properties engineers spend millions developing."
    
    # Scene 10 - was 17.01s
    "Each hexagon sized precisely for wasp larvae. No wasted space. Optimal protection."
    
    # Scene 11 - was 11.96s
    "Hexagons connect seamlessly. They share walls. Double strength. Half the material."
    
    # Scene 12 - was 14.45s
    "Minimum material for maximum volume. Perfect. An architect couldn't improve it."
    
    # Scene 13 - was 14.37s
    "Air channels between layers. Wasps maintain precise humidity and temperature inside."
    
    # Scene 14 - was 13.71s
    "Multiple layers provide insulation and protection. Rain can't penetrate. Walls are armor."
    
    # Scene 15 - was 14.29s
    "One wasp builds. Many wasps build faster. No supervision. Just instinct and intelligence."
    
    # Scene 16 - was 15.80s
    "Hundreds of hexagons. Thousands working in harmony. Architecture that rivals humans."
    
    # Scene 17 - was 14.45s
    "Humans saw this and copied it. Hexagons everywhere. We're learning from ancient teachers."
    
    # Scene 18 - was 18.44s
    "Fiber plus water plus pressure equals paper. The wasp discovered this millions of years ago."
    
    # Scene 19 - was 15.23s
    "Design optimization. Material efficiency. Structural integrity. Every specification perfect."
    
    # Scene 20 - was 17.71s
    "No wasp is smarter. No leader directs. Simple rules create complex optimal structures. Emergence."
    
    # Scene 21 - was 17.16s
    "Millions of years perfecting this design. Variations tested. Failures eliminated. Evolution did this."
    
    # Scene 22 - was 15.57s
    "Every hexagon serves a purpose. Protection. Incubation. Food storage. Function and form perfect."
    
    # Scene 23 - was 13.56s
    "Wasps aren't thinking about engineering. It's instinct. Millions of years of programming."
    
    # Scene 24 - was 25.08s
    "The hidden architect. Patient. Precise. Perfect. Practicing its craft in gardens."
