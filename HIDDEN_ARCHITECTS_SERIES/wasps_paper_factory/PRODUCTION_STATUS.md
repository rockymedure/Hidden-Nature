## 🎙️ PHASE 2 NARRATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Critical Requirements (MUST MEET)
- ✅ All 24 narrations exactly 8.000 seconds (after padding)
- ✅ No narration exceeds 7.8 seconds (before padding)
- ✅ Rachel voice used for all scenes
- ✅ 1.0x speed (NO SPEEDUP)
- ✅ Natural pacing and delivery

### Narration Summary
- **Total Narration Time**: 24 scenes × 8 seconds = 192 seconds (3:12)
- **Tone**: Intellectual, appreciative of engineering mastery, wonder at biomimicry
- **Content**: Architecture/design focus, material science, collective intelligence
- **Quality**: Broadcast-ready, precise delivery

### Audio Settings
- Model: eleven_turbo_v2_5
- Stability: 0.5 (natural)
- Similarity Boost: 0.75
- Style: 0.5
- Speed: 1.0

## ✨ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Narration Generation (Phase 2) is successful when:**

✅ All 24 MP3 files generated successfully
✅ All files are exactly 8.000 seconds
✅ No audio bleeding between scenes
✅ Rachel's voice is consistent throughout
✅ Narration is clear and prominent
✅ No clipping or distortion
✅ Final verification passes 100%

**Next Phase Ready When:**
All 24 narrations are exactly 8.000 seconds

## 🔗 DEPENDENCIES & SETUP

### Environment
- ✅ `.env` file present with `FAL_API_KEY`
- ✅ FFmpeg installed and accessible
- ✅ jq (JSON parser) installed
- ✅ curl available

### Verified
```bash
$ source .env
$ echo $FAL_API_KEY
9a4a90eb-250b-4953-95e4-86c2db1695fc:61a4e14a87c8e1e87820fe44e8317856
```

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### To Begin Phase 2:
```bash
cd /Users/rockymedure/Desktop/hidden_nature/HIDDEN_ARCHITECTS_SERIES/wasps_paper_factory
chmod +x generate_narrations.sh
./generate_narrations.sh
```

### What Happens:
1. Script validates environment
2. Generates 24 narrations via fal.ai API
3. Validates each narration (6.0-7.8s range)
4. Pads all to exactly 8.000 seconds
5. Final verification (all scenes exactly 8.0s)
6. Reports success/failure

### Expected Output:
- 24 files in `audio/` directory
- All exactly 8.000 seconds
- Ready for Phase 3 (video generation)

---

## 📊 ESTIMATED API COSTS

**Phase 2 (Narration Generation)**
- 24 narrations @ ~100-200 credits each
- Estimated: 2,400-4,800 credits

**Phases 3-6 (Video, Music, Mixing, Compilation)**
- Video: ~24,000 credits
- Music: ~4,800 credits
- Total: ~30,000-35,000 credits per full production

## 🎬 PRODUCTION READY CHECKLIST

- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Master script written (24 scenes)
- [x] Narration generation script ready
- [x] README documentation complete
- [x] 8-second timing enforced
- [x] API credentials verified
- [ ] Phase 2 execution (READY TO RUN)

**Status**: ✅ **ALL SYSTEMS GO - READY TO GENERATE NARRATIONS**

---

## 📞 SUPPORT NOTES

### If Narration Generation Fails:
1. Check `.env` file for valid FAL_API_KEY
2. Review `responses/scene{N}_response.json` for API errors
3. Check network connectivity
4. Verify Rachel voice is available via ElevenLabs
5. Try running individual scene manually for debugging

### If Timing is Off:
1. Script enforces 8.000s padding automatically
2. All scenes are verified in final check
3. If verification fails, regenerate that scene

### If Audio Quality Issues:
1. Stability set to 0.5 (balanced, natural)
2. Speed set to 1.0 (no compression)
3. Model: eleven_turbo_v2_5 (latest)
