# üêøÔ∏è THE NUT HEIST - Concept

**Tagline:** "One squirrel. One nut. Infinite paranoia."

**Story:** A squirrel finds the perfect acorn and becomes hilariously overprotective, defending it from a series of increasingly ridiculous "threats" (a falling leaf, a butterfly, another squirrel looking at it).
