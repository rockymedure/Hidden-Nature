SCENE_1_VISUAL="Deep space background with title appearing over cosmic vista"
SCENE_1_AUDIO="Welcome to The Cosmos Chronicles, where we explore the most extraordinary mysteries of our universe. Today, we embark on humanity's most perilous journey."
SCENE_2_VISUAL="Dramatic black hole with matter spiraling into darkness"
SCENE_2_AUDIO="Into the heart of a black hole. These cosmic monsters have fascinated scientists for over a century. But what would really happen if you fell into one?"
SCENE_3_VISUAL="Einstein working on equations, then spacetime visualization"
SCENE_3_AUDIO="To understand this ultimate fate, we must first grasp Einstein's revolutionary insight. Gravity isn't a force pulling objects together. Instead, massive objects actually bend the very fabric of space and time itself."
SCENE_4_VISUAL="Massive star in its final moments, then spectacular collapse"
SCENE_4_AUDIO="When a star twenty times more massive than our Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, the forces that have sustained it for millions of years suddenly fail. In less than a second, the core collapses catastrophically."
SCENE_5_VISUAL="Event horizon forming, invisible boundary visualization"
SCENE_5_AUDIO="The result is extraordinary. The star's matter becomes so dense that it warps spacetime beyond imagination, creating a boundary from which nothing can escape. Not even light itself."
SCENE_6_VISUAL="Spacecraft journey toward galactic center, approaching massive black hole"
SCENE_6_AUDIO="So imagine yourself as an astronaut, approaching the supermassive black hole at our galaxy's center. Sagittarius A-star contains four million times the mass of our Sun, yet occupies a region smaller than Mercury's orbit."
SCENE_7_VISUAL="Clocks showing different rates, time distortion effects"
SCENE_7_AUDIO="As you venture closer, you encounter one of nature's most bizarre phenomena. Time itself begins to slow down relative to the rest of the universe. Your clocks run normally from your perspective, but to distant observers, you appear to freeze."
SCENE_8_VISUAL="The moment of crossing, surprisingly peaceful transition"
SCENE_8_AUDIO="Then comes the moment of truth. Crossing the event horizon feels utterly ordinary. There's no wall, no barrier, no dramatic sensation. Yet you've just passed the point of no return."
SCENE_9_VISUAL="Strange interior geometry, physics equations dissolving"
SCENE_9_AUDIO="Inside this realm, the familiar laws of physics begin to break down completely. Space and time exchange their roles in ways that defy human intuition. You're falling not just through space, but toward a place where our mathematics itself fails."
SCENE_10_VISUAL="Cosmic wonder, unanswered questions, future discoveries"
SCENE_10_AUDIO="What truly lies at a black hole's center remains one of the greatest mysteries in all of science. Perhaps the answer will reshape our understanding of reality itself. The journey into darkness continues to illuminate the deepest truths about our cosmos."
