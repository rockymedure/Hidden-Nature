# Visual Dynamics System - Netflix-Quality Environmental Storytelling
**UPDATE: Character Consistency + Location Variety + Visual Memory**

## üéØ **CORE PRINCIPLE**
**Characters stay consistent, environments change dynamically, locations have memory**

---

## ü¶ï **CHARACTER CONSISTENCY SYSTEM**

### **Master Character Seed: 77777**
- Used for **ALL character-focused scenes** across entire documentary
- Ensures same dinosaur family appearance throughout story
- Maintains character recognition and emotional connection

### **Character Description Template**
```
"The same reddish-brown Carnotaurus family with distinctive forward-facing horns -
large protective mother with yellow eyes and battle scars on left flank,
two smaller juveniles with developing horns and playful demeanor"
```
- **Include in every single prompt** to maintain character consistency
- **Specific details** (scars, eye color, horn development) for recognition
- **Personality traits** (protective mother, playful juveniles) for behavior consistency

## üåç **DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT SYSTEM**

- **Forest Home**: Seed 77777 (matches character seed for familiar territory)
- **Open Plains**: Seed 77778 (hunting grounds, vast horizons)

- **River Valley**: Seed 77780 (chase sequence, water elements)
- **Cave Shelter**: Seed 77781 (safety, intimate family moments)
