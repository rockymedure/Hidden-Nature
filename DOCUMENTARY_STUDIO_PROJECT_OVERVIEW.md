AI ASSISTANT: "I can help with that! Scene 8 is currently 11.2 seconds with 28 words. 

For timing: Let's trim to 15-18 words targeting 7.5 seconds. Here's an optimized version:
'The paramecium spins and darts, using evolution's survival tricks to escape death.'

For visuals: Your current description could be more specific. Try:
'Extreme close-up paramecium rapidly changing direction, cilia beating frantically, predator approaching from frame edge, dramatic escape maneuvers with spinning motion'

Would you like me to analyze the educational flow impact of this change?"
